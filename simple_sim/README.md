## what is Jacobian matrix
Jacobian matrix is a matrix of partial derivatives. Jacobian is the determinant of the jacobian matrix. The matrix will contain all partial derivatives of a vector function. The main use of Jacobian is found in the transformation of coordinates. which we have calculated in the following case for a rotating-sliding robot
## Example
First, the Jacobian matrix is calculated, then simulated, to find out about the example information, refer to the photo below.
